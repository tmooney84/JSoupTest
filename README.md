# JSoupTest

There are two files that contain workable demostrations of JSoup in action:  

1)Main.java includes the code for pulling Author and Quote information from https://brightdata.com/blog/how-tos/user-agents-for-web-scraping-101). Resource: https://brightdata.com/blog/how-tos/web-scraping-with-jsoup  

2)Surf_Captain3.java has an operational version of scaping the ten seperate webpages for current wave height data. Cheers!
